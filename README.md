## Purpose of This Project
The primary goal of this project is to delve into and master contemporary technologies. This endeavor serves as a platform for my exploration, learning, and practical application of various cutting-edge tools in the realm of web development.

## Tech Stack
In this project, I have harnessed a combination of robust and modern technologies to create an efficient and user-friendly experience. Here's a breakdown of the tech stack I used:

- **Vite**: I chose Vite for its remarkable speed and simplicity, significantly enhancing the development workflow with its incredibly fast front-end build tool capabilities.

- **Vue**: Vue.js is adopted for its reactivity and composability. It's a progressive framework for building user interfaces, allowing for an interactive and dynamic experience on the web app.

- **Pinia**: As the store library, Pinia is used for state management in Vue applications. Its intuitive and straightforward API makes managing and accessing states across components efficient and straightforward.

- **Basscss**: For styling, I use Basscss, which offers a lightweight collection of base element styles and immutable utilities. Its simplicity and composability make it an excellent choice for creating responsive designs with ease.

- **Ant Design Vue**: Integrated into the project is Ant Design Vue, which brings the enterprise-level UI design language of Ant Design to Vue applications. It provides a comprehensive set of high-quality Vue components that enhance the overall user interface and experience.

- **Firebase Auth**: Firebase Auth is incorporated for its reliable and easy-to-use authentication system. It provides a secure way to manage user sessions and identity, ensuring a safe user experience.

- **Cloud Firestore**: I use Cloud Firestore for data storage and real-time updates. It's a flexible and scalable database from Firebase and Google Cloud.
